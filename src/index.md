# What's going on?

This is a freely available draft of the *GPU Handbook*, a quick-start guide into the world of General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit computation.

All of the written text on this site was created by [James Schloss](https://github.com/leios) and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-NC-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).
This means that you are free to read, copy, modify, and remix any of the content here with a few key restrictions.
Namely, the new (derivative) work:
1. Cannot make money.
2. Must attribute me (James Schloss or Leios).
3. Must be available for free with the same Creative Commons license. In other words, derivatives of derivatives of this work cannot make money and also must attribute me (and any additional authors).

Obviously, it is a bit absurd to provide this book to everyone for free.
In doing so, it becomes much more difficult to traditionally publishing the book, so it is unlikely you will ever see this book in book stores any time soon.
That said, it *is* possible for me to self-publish the book so you can buy kindle and physical copies from Amazon.

Long story short, here is what I ask: **if you enjoy this book or the associated videos and livestreams, please consider purchasing it when it is officially released**.

On my end, I will set the prices so that I will receive 5 USD back from every sale.
I also promise that all the revenue will go directly into funding more projects from me (and my eventual team).
If there are enough books purchased, I plan to hire a distribution manager to help reduce the cost of each one as well.

I guess that's all for now.
Thanks for your interest in the novel and Leios Labs!

Peace,  
James (Leios)
